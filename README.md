# Python Project Indexer

This simple Python script will index any Python Project and save all the functions and their signatures into a file called `functions.json`

## Quick start
```console
git clone https://github.com/ABFStudio/PPI.git
cd PPI
python main.py
```

Before running the script, make sure to change the folder you want to index at the bottom of `main.py`.
